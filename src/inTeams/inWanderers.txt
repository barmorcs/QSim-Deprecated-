Years on Team: 3
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Gryffindor

Name: Onyx Black
Team: Wigtown Wanderers
Position: Beater
Age: 31
Years on Team: 2
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Slytherin
Reputation: Onyx has hopped around the league quite a bit, including a stint in South America where he played for a team in the Amazon. He doesn't like to stay in one place for too long, and frequently breaks team rules leading him to get kicked off. He is also prone to fights with both referees and fans. He's not particularly talented with wand work and instead chooses to utilize his fists. Fans are mixed about Onyx. Most loyal fans do not trust him since he's hopped around the league so much, though other fans enjoy his brutal plays and ability to play dirty.
Playing style: Aggressive, cunning, physical
