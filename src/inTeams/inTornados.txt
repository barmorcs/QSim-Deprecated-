Name: Muir Crawford
Team: Tutshill Tornados
Position: Keeper
Age: 38
Years on Team: 16
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Gryffindor
Reputation: A bit of a bumbling idiot at times, but loveable all the same. He makes the most of his massive body and has team spirit in droves. His detractors still make rude comments about him being part giant, though.
Playing style: physical, direct, confident
Name: Jesse King
Team: Tutshill Tornadoes
Position: Seeker
Age: 27
Years on Team: 8
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts / Ravenclaw
Reputation: "An generational talent that tests the patience of the masses." Jesse is a once in a generational talent, hailing from the opposite side of the globe; however his motivation and desire, along with off-field tomfoolery, has been a constant question mark throughout his career. These issues have sent fans and reporters to the brink in the past, only for him to put on a few world class displays to make them wonder why they ever doubted him. When on his game, he is undoubtedly one of the best seekers in the league; but you might as well flip a coin to decide whether a motivated Jesse King turns up or not.
Playing style: Confidant, Selfish, Skillful
Name: Emmanuel Narh
Team: Tutshill Tornadoes
Position: Chaser
Age: 38
Years on Team: 16
Alma Mater/House: Uagadou School of Magic
Reputation: Emmanuel, also known as Manny, grew up in the magical city of Patonga in Uganda. He was an orphan being raised by an extended family member, and in his prime was known as quite the underdog. He left the team to retire after his 15th anniversary, but was persuaded to come back to the team when no other Chaser would work with the impossible Harper twins. This is his first year back on the team and some fans are uncertain if he came keep up with his former Golden Boy status. 
Playing style: Confident, creative, skillful 
Name: Indigo Harper
Team: Tutshill Tornados
Position: Chaser
Age: 23
Years on Team: 5
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Ravenclaw
Reputation: Fans are unsure what to think of Indigo and her identical twin sister, Scarlett. The two rarely speak to media, are completely anti-social, intensely private. As twins, they have the uncanny 'twin' ability to know exactly what the other one is thinking and their teamwork is flawless. It is because of this flawless teamwork that fans of the Tornados like the twins.
Playing style: cunning, aggressive, organized
Name: Scarlett Harper
Team: Tutshill Tornados
Position: Chaser
Age: 23
Years on Team: 5
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Ravenclaw
Reputation: Scarlett is the more popular of the twins, as she is the one who is seen out in public a little more. Otherwise, her reputation is the same as her twins'. "The two rarely speak to media, are completely anti-social, intensely private. As twins, they have the uncanny 'twin' ability to know exactly what the other one is thinking and their teamwork is flawless. It is because of this flawless teamwork that fans of the Tornados like the twins."

Name: Irina Clift
Team: Tutshill Tornadoes
Position: Beater, Captain
Age: 35
Years on Team: 17
Alma Mater/House: Slytherin/Hogwarts
Reputation: Not someone that you'd want to cross paths with, Irina is the player that fans love to hate. She's blunt, mean, and scary. But she gets the job done. She only took a few months of leave (the healers didn't recommend it but there was no standing up to her), and fans were overjoyed to have her back on the pitch. 
Playing style: Cunning, aggressive, collaborative
Name: Apus Bayer
Team: Tutshill Tornados
Position: Beater
Age: 31
Years on Team: 6
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Slytherin
Reputation: Nobody really knows why Apus was placed in Slytherin. Of course he fits the physical mold for the frightening house. Nor is he intelligent enough for Ravenclaw or brave enough for Gryffindor. But truth be told, The Ape is extremely boring. Fans, while initially excited for a "mean-lean fighting machine" were quite disappointed after realizing The Apus was only scary from afar. Up-front, despite being strong, he is incredibly cautious and afraid of everything including the snitch. He makes for a scary player initially, but does little to hinder chances for the other team aside from blocking bludgers. 
Playing style: Cautious, Physical, Aggressive
