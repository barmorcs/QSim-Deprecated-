Kenmare Kestrels
Name: Conor Mooney
Team: Kenmare Kestrels
Position: Keeper
Age: 21
Years on Team: 3
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Slytherin
Reputation: A rookie who still needs to prove himself, though has had a few game-making saves in his short years. He has a lot of personality and flair which gets him attention from commentators but overall his reception to the team has been lukewarm. Also seen as a bit of a womanizer off the field.
Playing style: Direct, creative, aggressive
Name: Morrigan Nishihara
Team: Kenmare Kestrels
Position: Seeker
Age: 36
Years on Team: 10
Alma Mater/House: Ivermorny/Pukwudgie
Reputation: A bit of an oddball, but loved for her talents. She is immensely graceful under pressure to the point that fans can hardly blame her for a missed snitch. Initially her acceptance was lukewarm due to her being American, but she proved herself quickly.
Playing style: Skillful, confident, fast 
Name: Mortimer Price
Team: Kenmare Kestrels
Position: Chaser
Age: 31
Years on Team: 14
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Slytherin
Reputation: Uncannily at home on a broomstick. Fans alternate between singing his praises and joking about how he probably eats and sleeps in the air as well. Some people find this aspect of him “creepy”, especially combined with his subdued demeanor and skeletal appearance. Still, his talents in the air are hard to overlook and he is generally regarded as a capable chaser. 
Playing style: Skillful, cunning, organized
Name: Róisín Byrne
Team: Kenmare Kestrels
Position: Chaser
Age: 29
Years on Team: 7
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Ravenclaw
Reputation: While never a fan favorite, Róisín is generally seen as an indispensible member of the Kestrels' group of chasers. Her playing is dependable yet often not flashy enough to get her the notice she deserves. Some die-hard fans see her as the unsung hero of the team, but Róisín doesn’t mind being overshadowed by her showier teammates, preferring to be the mind behind the magic.
Playing style: Physical, organized, collaborative
Name: Aoife Skelley
Team: Kenmare Kestrels
Position: Chaser
Age: 25
Years on Team: 8
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Gryffindor
Reputation: Showy and flashy, but luckily has enough skill to back up that demeanor. She tends to get on the nerves of the other chasers for her egotistical playing style. Fans can’t get enough of her fancy quaffle work. 
Playing style: Cunning, selfish, aggressive 
Name: Ler O’Rahilly
Team: Kenmare Kestrels
Position: Beater, Captain
Age: 34
Years on Team: 17
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Gryffindor
Reputation: No-nonsense on the field, a good laugh otherwise. Ler takes Quidditch seriously and expects that his teammates do the same. He has been lovingly nicknamed “King Ler” during his time as captain, an indication of his straightforward style of leadership. As a beater he is calculating and ruthless with his hits, almost to the point of playing dirty.
Playing style: Direct, aggressive, organized 
Name: Quinlan MacEnroe
Team: Kenmare Kestrels
Position: Beater
Age: 26
Years on Team: 5
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Hufflepuff
Reputation: Seen as a bit fragile for his position, possibly too soft of a disposition to be the beater the team needs. His teamwork is flawless and he hardly lets the fans down, though they usually have to depend on Captain O’Rahilly for the satisfying bat cracks they crave. A heart of gold, though.
Playing style: Physical, cautious, collaborative
