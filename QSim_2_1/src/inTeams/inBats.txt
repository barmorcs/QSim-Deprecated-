Ballycastle Bats
Name: Ben Russell
Team: Ballycastle Bats
Position: Keeper, Captain
Age: 34
Years on Team: 17
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Ravenclaw
Reputation: Ben is not well-liked as Captain. There is a lot of tension between him, Archie Booth, and Gideon Sloan for the position of Captain. They have been through the ringer together, but even though Ben has the most seniority, many believe that it’s really Sloan that deserves to be Captain. This has caused a rift between one of the greatest trio friendships in professional Quidditch. 
Playing style: cautious, creative, collaborative

Position: Seeker
Age: 21
Years on Team: 4
