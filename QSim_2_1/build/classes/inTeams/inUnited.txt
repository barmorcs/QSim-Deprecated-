Puddlemere United
Name: Cadmus Carmondy
Team: Puddlemere United
Position: Keeper
Age: 20
Years on Team: 3
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Hufflepuff
Reputation: With a standout career at Hogwarts- outside of Quidditch too- Cadmus had developed a supportive fanbase around the UK, especially made of former Hufflepuffs, but lost some popularity when deciding to sign with the always-successful Puddlemere United team. He is a very traditional Keeper and is known for hollering enthusiastic encouragements and corrective suggestions alike while in front of his rings.
Playing style: collaborative, confident, aggressive
Name: Curtis Payne
Team: Puddlemore United
Position: Seeker
Age: 35
Years on Team: 1
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Slytherin
Reputation: A bit of a loose cannon, Curtis Payne has been on more Quidditch Teams than there are months in the year. He's not a fan favorite, per say, but fans follow his trajectory religiously if only because they can't stop watching him spiral out of control. 
Playing style: Selfish, Flashy, Creative

Name: Bijou Babineaux
Team: Puddlemore United
Position: Chaser
Age: 37
Years on Team: 12
Alma Mater/House: Académie de Magie Beauxbâtons
Reputation: Steady and consistent player though she is, fans are split on their adoration for Bijou. On the one hand, the male fans love her. Long blonde hair, icy blue eyes -- it's hard not to stare. But the female fans on the other-hand have petitioned for her removal on numerous occasions. Though her most adamant detractors are known to picket occasionally, over the past 12 years she's won considerable respect. 
Playing style: Aggressive, selfish, confident

Name: Sebastian Calloway 
Team: Puddlemere United
Position: Beater
Age: 31
Years on Team: 4
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Gryffindor
Reputation: Sebastian has been on the professional level for a while, though he started out in leagues on the main European continent. Eventually he made his way back home to the Isles and has made a name for himself: boisterous, hearty, blunt and a seasoned drinker, everyone knows Sebatian Calloway. His voice, originating from deep in his husky guy, carries with power across the pitch, much as the bludgers that his tree-trunk arms blast away at, and opponents like to throw glares at the timeliness of his taunting, thunderous laughter.
Playing style: Physical, direct, creative

Years on Team: 7
