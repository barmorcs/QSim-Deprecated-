Name: Jacob Allen
Team: Falmouth Falcons
Position: Keeper
Age: 25
Years on Team: 8
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Gryffindor
Reputation: Jacob is one of the younger players on the team, but he is not to be underestimated.

He is known for working well under pressure and being warm and friendly even with the most zealous of fans. 
Playing style: direct, confident, organized
Name: Alaric Shields
Team: Falmouth Falcons
Position: Seeker
Age: 28
Years on Team: 11
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Ravenclaw 
Reputation: Alaric is known as one of the most brilliant Seekers the Falcons have ever had. It’s also rumored that when they were convincing him to sign on, they promised him more money than ever offered a rookie. He’s certainly earned it, too, having caught Snitches against some of the best Seekers in the league. Alaric has been hit or miss, though, due to some injuries that have kept him on the bench what seems to be every other season. 
Playing style: cunning, creative, quick
Name: Sawyer Ashbury
Team: Falmouth Falcons
Position: Chaser
Age: 28
Years on Team: 1
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Gryffindor
Reputation: "The player that no one can understand why they are still on the team..." certainly seems to apply to others' opinions of her, no matter however entirely unfounded and untrue. This in turn drives Sawyer to prove herself and, simultaneously, them wrong.
Playing style: Creative, skillful, collaborative

Name: Emerald Keller
Team: Falmouth Falcons
Position: Chaser
Age: 23
Years on Team: 5
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Hufflepuff
Reputation: Emerald is always underestimated by most people in the world, from fans to other players. She’s one of the smallest players in the league, and appears quite breakable. What she lacks in stature, however, she makes up in ferocity and that fact has won over even the most cold hearted fans. 
Playing style: quick, skillful, aggressive
Name: Cedric Donnohart
Team: Falmouth Falcons
Position: Beater, Captain
Age: 34
Years on Team: 16
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Gryffindor
Reputation: Cedric loves to keep the Falcon’s tradition of playing dirty. He encourages his players to be rough and rowdy with other teams and to be unafraid of fouls. He is also a fan favorite and happily and humbly gives out autographs whenever asked. Cedric has a reputation for being all about the ladies and has a long list of short lived relationships. He is also now rumored to be dating Sawyer Ashbury, and has taken some flak for supposedly getting her on to the team. 
Playing style: direct, skillful, confident
Name: Ian McKellan
Team: Falmouth Falcons
Position: Beater
Age: 31
Years on Team: 14
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Slytherin
Reputation: On the field, Ian is known for being one of the roughest players in the League. He currently holds the record for most fouls called on a single player during their career. Off the field, however, he shows no aggressive traits and is, in fact, a total sweetheart. Even though his former house is Slytherin, he is known for being a very fun and light-hearted guy and a total lady’s man. He and his fellow Beater have a strong bond and it’s rumored that Ian would be a shoe-in for Captain if Donnohart ever retired. 
Playing style: physical, cunning, aggressive
