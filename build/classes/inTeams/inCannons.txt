Age: 18
Years on Team: 0
Alma Mater/House: Beauxbatons

Name: Axel Alderich
Team: Chudley Cannons
Position: Chaser
Age: 26
Years on Team: 6
Alma Mater/House: Durmstrang
Reputation: Axel is not exactly beloved by fans. An incredibly loyal bunch, Chudley Cannons fans were not immediately smitten by the foreigner who came to play for their team. Talented though he is, Axel isn't particularly fun to watch since his plays are extremely quick and efficient. He has become extremely respected among most fans, the most dedicated spectators agreeing that he's a huge asset to the Cannons.

Name: Artemis Greco
Team: Chudley Cannons
Position: Chaser
Age: 53
Years on Team: 35
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts/Gryffindor
Reputation: The majority of fans hardly notice Artemis as he so frequently trails behind the other chasers during games. He is clearly past his prime and most fans are counting down the days until he is forced to retire. Some older male fans stay loyal; however, and he has amassed quite an International following over the years. 
Playing style: Skillful, confident, direct
Name: Elias Storm
Team: Chudley Cannons
Position: chaser
Age: 23
Years on Team: 3
Alma Mater/House: Durmstrang
Reputation: Elias stormed into the British league with a lot of hype, however it's becoming increasingly clear that he doesn't have the same talent as his older brother. The best fans can say is that he is a solid player who may not have peaked yet, but 3 years on and he is still yet to do so. Unlike his brother, he has not been selected for the Nordic team, and at this rate, never will be.
Playing style: cautious, fast, collaborative
Name: Benjamin Lawrence
Team: Chudley Cannons
Position: Beater
Age: 27
Years on Team: 10
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Gryffindor
Reputation: It’s hard to distinguish Ben from his brother Sam, on and off the field. The twins are often thought of together as their own mini team. They are known as fairly decent players and have a reputation for pretending to be the other and confusing their fans. They have been Canons fans since they were eleven and would never dream of switching teams.
