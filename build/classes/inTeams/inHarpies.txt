Position: Keeper
Age: 37
Years on Team: 20

Reputation: Giselle is a sweetheart, known for being the woman on the Harpies with the most seniority. She was offered the position of Captain but turned it down so she could see her family more. On the field she is a true team player, treating her teammates and opposition with the same respect. She remains warm and welcoming no matter what kind of aggression she is faced with. 
Playing style: Skillful, confident, collaborative

Name: Eleanora Nolan
Team: Holyhead Harpies
Position: Chaser
Age: 31
Years on Team: 13
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Gryffindor
Reputation: Eleanora is quite famous in the Quidditch community, mostly for breaking the long-standing tradition that the Holyhead Harpies only sign women who’s names start with ‘G’. The captain at the time, Gillespie Davies, signed the first player who’s name did not start with ‘G’: a spunky young Chaser who would have otherwise gone to another team. This act of defiance caused several members of the team to quit and the Harpies saw a great turnover. Their team is quite young but thanks to Gillespie and later Eleanora, they are returning to their former glory. Eleanora was hated by traditionalists but loved by new age fans. After her wife was killed after a famous match by a group of Muggle-haters, she nearly quit the league entirely. She remains, but doesn’t withhold her contempt for supposed ‘fans’. She no longer poses for photos or gives out autographs. 
Playing style: skillful, confident, collaborative

Position: Chaser
Age: 21
Years on Team: 3

Reputation: Beloved by all for her bravery and determination, she is a beacon of hope for all. While most fans adore her, more critical fans feel that her resignation would leave a spot open for a more trained and skilled chaser.

Name: Teddy Cartwright
Team: Holyhead Harpies
Position: Beater
Age: 29
Years on Team: 11
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Gryffindor
Reputation: Teddy is easily mistaken for a boy. There was outcry by fans initially that made managers double and triple check the status of Teddy's chromosomes. As it turned out, Teddy was very much a girl. Fans are pretty ambivalent towards her. She packs a mean punch and is fun to watch, but other than that she's a pretty average player. 
Playing style: Physical, Cunning, Skillful

Alma Mater/House: homeschooled
Reputation: Male fans refer to her often enough as butch due to her surprising strength and boyish appearance. True fans of the team have no problem with this however.
