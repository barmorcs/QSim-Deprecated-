Name: Kirsty Buchanan
Team: Pride of Portree
Position: Beater, Captain
Age: 33
Years on Team: 14
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Slytherin
Reputation: Despite her long stint on the team, some of the less-versed fans don't really care for her. It's one of the few reasons why she'll never make captain. Talented and engaging player though she is, her father's legacy still casts a heavy shadow on her career. Though it was one of the main reasons why the Pride of Portree worked so hard to draft Kirsty, it also remains a hindrance in her ability to resonate with fans. It's a bit of a catch-22. She's very blunt and cold to her fans, mostly because she anticipates that they already despise her. This only alienates her further from the fans that don't really know what to think. Luckily, however, the most faithful Portree fans adore her. Those who know her story and have heard her talk freely in interviews (or after-parties after a few fire-whiskies) know how much of a true and faithful player she is. 
Playing style: Cautious, skillful, collaborative
Name: Emmett Boone
Team: Pride of Portree

Age: 27
Years on Team: 10
Alma Mater/House: Hogwarts, Slytherin
Reputation: Snobbish and manipulative, Boone tends to rub people the wrong way. While deep down he is a kind and self-conscious fellow, he tends to overwhelm people with his lanky features and haunted eyes. 
Playing style: skillful, cautious, fast
